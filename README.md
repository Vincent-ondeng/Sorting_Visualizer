# Sorting_Visualizer
Contains code for a sorting algorithm visualizer
##Building a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in Python

Under building a sorting algorithm we will visualize merge and bubble sort algorithms.

##Team:
The team members of the sorting algorithm are:

Christabel Okwisa -  implementing bubble sort
Vincent Ondeng - visualization of sorting algorithms
Dainah Wanjiku - implementing merge sort

We decided on these roles because each one of us is comfortable with the roles provided.
Each person is responsible for the quality and timely completion of the task to ensure accountability that can help team members identify and address challenges such as missing resources or delays.

##Technologies:

The languages and libraries in use are python, tkinter and pygame. A blog post about sorting algorithms will be used.
We chose these particular technologies because they are simpler to use and understand.
